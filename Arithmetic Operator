#Python code: Arithmetic Operator

a = int(raw_input())
b = int(raw_input())
print(a+b) #prints sum of a & b
print(a-b) #prints differnce of a & b
print(a*b) #prints product of a & b
print(a/b) #prints quotient of a & b
print(a%b) #prints remainder of a & b
print(a//b) #prints same as % but rounds off the result
